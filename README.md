This application randomly generates passwords for the user each time they click the generate password button. When the user first opens the page, they are prompted with a series of questions where they can specify the criteria that they would like the password to meet. Options include being able to specify a minimum length of at least 8 and a maximum of no more than 128, whether they'd like uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. After choosing these options, the generate password will generate a new randomized length and password to fit the criteria that was specified. If the user chooses not to specify, the default password will be 10 of any of the four types of characters. The user can click copy to clipboard if they'd like to copy it out of the browser and previously generated passwords are displayed below until the user refreshes the page.
